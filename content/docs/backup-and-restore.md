Drivest lets you export and import your vehicle data using `.drivestbackup` files. This is useful for creating backups or transferring data between devices.

## Exporting Data

1. Go to **Settings > Manage Vehicles**.
2. Tap the vehicle you want to export.
3. In the vehicle detail screen, scroll to the **Data** section.
4. Tap **Export Data**.
5. Choose where to save or share the file using the iOS share sheet (e.g. save to Files, send via AirDrop, email).

The export creates a `.drivestbackup` file containing all data for that vehicle: fill-ups, costs, reminders, photos, and attachments.

## Importing Data

There are two ways to import:

### From the vehicle detail screen

1. Go to **Settings > Manage Vehicles**.
2. Tap the vehicle you want to import into.
3. Scroll to the **Data** section.
4. Tap **Import Data...** and select a `.drivestbackup` file.

### By opening a file

Tap any `.drivestbackup` file on your device (e.g. from the Files app or an email attachment). Drivest will open and show an import preview.

## Import Preview

Before importing, the app shows a preview of the data in the file and lets you choose an import strategy:

- **Merge** — adds the imported data alongside your existing records. Duplicate entries are skipped.
- **Replace** — replaces the vehicle's existing data with the imported data.

Review the preview carefully before confirming.

## What's Included in a Backup

- Vehicle information (name, make, model, VIN, settings)
- All fill-up records with photos
- All cost entries with photos and file attachments
- Reminders
- Electricity bills (for EV vehicles)

## What's Not Included

- App-wide settings (currency, categories, appearance)
- Connected service credentials (authentication tokens)

## Tips

- Export your data regularly, especially before updating iOS or switching devices.
- Store backups in iCloud Drive or another cloud service for safekeeping.
- You can export and import individual vehicles — there is no "export all" option, so back up each vehicle separately.
