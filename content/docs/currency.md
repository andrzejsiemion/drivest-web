Drivest supports multiple currencies, which is useful if you travel across borders or buy fuel in different countries.

## Default Currency

Your default currency is used for statistics and summaries.

1. Go to **Settings > Currency**.
2. Select your default currency from the list.

All amounts in the Statistics tab are shown in your default currency.

## Additional Currencies

You can add extra currencies to use when logging fill-ups or costs in a foreign currency.

1. Go to **Settings > Currency**.
2. Tap **Add Currency** (requires a default currency to be set first).
3. Select the currency from the list.

When you add a fill-up or cost, a currency selector appears next to the price fields if you have more than one currency configured.

<!-- SCREENSHOT: Currency settings — the Currency settings screen showing the default currency picker at the top (e.g. "PLN"), the additional currencies section below with one or two currencies listed (e.g. "EUR" with rate "4.3000" and last updated date), and the "Add Currency" and "Refresh Rates Now" buttons. -->

## Exchange Rates

Exchange rates are fetched automatically from the **NBP** (National Bank of Poland) API. Rates are updated periodically and can be refreshed manually.

### Automatic Rates

- The app fetches exchange rates from NBP when you add a new currency or when rates are refreshed.
- The date of the last rate update is shown in the currency settings.

### Manual Rates

You can override any exchange rate manually:
1. Tap the rate value for a currency in the settings.
2. Enter your preferred rate.
3. The currency will be marked as "Manual".
4. To revert to the NBP rate, tap **Reset to NBP**.

### How Rates Work

Rates are expressed as: **1 [additional currency] = X [default currency]**.

For example, if your default currency is PLN and you add EUR with a rate of 4.30, it means 1 EUR = 4.30 PLN. When you log a fill-up for 50 EUR, the app records it as approximately 215 PLN in your statistics.

## Removing a Currency

Swipe left on a currency in the settings to remove it. This does not affect previously recorded entries — they keep the exchange rate that was active when they were saved.
